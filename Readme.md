## Stages
**Stage #1 Hello, Hangman**  
Welcome the user: print “The game will be available soon”.

**Stage #2 I want to play the game**  
For starters, let’s give the player only one chance to guess the word. Learn and use “Input” and “if” to implement this stage.

**Stage #3 Make your choice**  
Let’s make the game more challenging: now it will randomly choose one of four words from a list.

**Stage #4 Help is on the way**  
Enable hints in your game: let it show the total length of the word or its first three letters. Slicing will help you implement this part.

**Stage #5 Keep trying**  
Use a loop to extend the number of attempts to eight. Now we’re talking!

**Stage #6 The value of life**  
The outcome of the game may be fatal, which makes the game all the more exciting. Implement this feature so that players don’t lose strikes when they guess a letter right. The While loop will help.

**Stage #7 Error!**  
Improve the game by handling different error cases. Repeating a letter, entering too many characters, or using non-Latin characters shouldn’t cost your player a strike.

**Stage #8 Menu, please**  
While a dinner starts with the menu, our project ends with one. Create a menu for your game so that players can replay it or exit.
